The supplementary materials contain two videos in the AVI format, showing cases with median performance in terms of Dice scores, either in the challenge dataset or the NU dataset. For example, 'Median_case_challenge_Data' presents the case with median performance in terms of Dice scores within the challenge dataset.

In each video, every frame corresponds to a slice, with groundtruth outlined in red and predictions outlined in green. 


Green lines: prediction
Red lines: groundtruth
Yellow: slice index
