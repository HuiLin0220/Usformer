## Instructions
- [Installation instructions]  
      git clone git clone https://github.com/HuiLin0220/Usformer.git
      cd Usformer
      pip install -e.
- [Usformer](nnunetv2/dynamic_network_architectures/architectures/unet.py) A new architecture, Usformer, is created here.
- [Architecture hyperparameters](nnunetv2/utilities/get_network_from_plans.py) Edit architecture hyperparameters in Function 'get_network_from_plans'.
- [Edit Usformer]  
      Refer to nnU-Net's [Extending nnU-Net](documentation/extending_nnunet.md)  
      [Image normalization](documentation/explanation_normalization.md)

## Oversampling
-oversample_foreground_percent of patches must contain LA
-num_iterations_per_epoch * batch_size * oversample_foreground_percent patches must contain LA
